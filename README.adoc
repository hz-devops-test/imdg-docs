This repository contains the Antora components for the Hazelcast IMDG documentation.

The documentation source files are marked up with AsciiDoc.

== Docs Structure

This section describes some important information about how this repository is structured:

- The component name, version, and start page are configured in each branch's `antora.yml` file.
- The navigation for all modules is stored in the ROOT module's `nav.adoc` file.
- Production branches use the *vX.Y* naming pattern (for example, v4.1), and the `master` branch contains the latest content.
- The {url-playbook}[docs site playbook] instructs Antora to automatically aggregate content in the `master` branch as well as any branch names that start with *v*.
